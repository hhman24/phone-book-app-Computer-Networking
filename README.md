# 👨‍💻 Phone Book App - Socket IO

Write a program consisting of a server application and a client application to manage a "digital directory" using Sockets, with TCP at the Transport layer. This directory manages the information of members in an organization. Information for a member includes: code, full name, phone number, email, avatar. Contacts are stored on the server along with image files, the server provides services so that the client can query the directory (list of members) and query information for each member.
